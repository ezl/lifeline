Create a lifeline.

Also save your lifeline to a file (CSV) or load a previously saved lifeline.

Reminder to myself:

To deploy:
https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app/blob/master/packages/react-scripts/template/README.md#github-pages

Ideas:
- Mobile friendliness? Off canvas UX for left/right sides
- Confirm before deleting
- UI feedback on new event entry / entry deletion
- Order entries on load
- Save data/lifelines for sending to other people
- Password protect a lifeline if it can be persisted to the server
